# 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Temi Kolawole

I’m a systems-focused software engineer, entrepreneur, and technology leader working at the intersection of **technology, digital governance, and innovation ecosystems**. I design and build digital systems that enable scalable infrastructure, institutional efficiency, and high-impact entrepreneurship — with strong relevance to African markets.

Currently, I lead the <a href="https://iih.ng" target="_blank">Ilorin Innovation Hub</a>, a public–private initiative of the <a href="https://kwarastate.gov.ng" target="_blank">Kwara State Government</a> in partnership with <a href="https://ihstowers.com" target="_blank">IHS Towers</a> in Nigeria. My work spans digital infrastructure, programs, and cross-sector partnerships that support developers, startups, and emerging digital talent at ecosystem level.

### 📊 GitHub Stats

Most of my large-scale, institutional, and production work lives in private repositories or live environments, so public activity represents only a portion of what I build.
